# synthetic-lethality-pipeline

This repository contains a computational pipeline to predict synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs in humans using single-cell RNA sequencing data

---

## Project Overview

- Predicts gene pairs whose co-absence is lethal using scRNA-seq data as input.
- Input data obtained from Human Protein Atlas and Tabula Sapiens.
---

- matrix_generation_SL.ipynb - code to generate co-absence matrix
- hepatocyte.csv - potential SL pairs in hepatocyte cell type
